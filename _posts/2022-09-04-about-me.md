### How Did I Get Here?

While I am a S.W. major here at CNU, I'm also a senior trying to collect those final credits to graduate. That is how I ended up taking this course, my major advsior recommended it to me saying that it was, "not that hard" and that she heard it was fun from previous students. Regardless of the needs for the credits or however I got here via Dr. Valutis I am still excited! As the course has progressed, it isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be and that makes it fun. As my digital foot print increases and I find myself slowly opening up about my life on my social media platforms I see this class being beneficial in navigating that.

### Social Work

I found social work as I was actually on the way to wanting a degree in Political Science. I took an entry level course and the rest is history. I discovered there was so much more to social work than just CPS or the borderline negative tropes of the field. 

But it was the discovery of _Prental Social Work_ that really put the final “nail” on the coffin as many life to say. I had a passion for kids, babies to be specific, and stumbled upon subsection that dealt primarily with expecting moms and their support system. Getting them access to clothes, food, furniture, transportation. But also enrolling them in parenting class and urging many to break the cycle. This spoke to me because I had seen and heard so many instances of young moms wanting more for their unborn child but not sure about how to go about that. And when Roe V Wade was overturned I knew help and compassion was going to be needed more then ever only making me fully confident, excited and inspired for the field at hand.
