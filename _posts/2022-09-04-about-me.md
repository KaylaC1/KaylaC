## About Me
Hi hi! Summing up a little bit about you in a few hundred words is harder then I thought! But I'm Kayla Caine (pronouns she/her) and I'm a Social Work major at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/sswa/).

### How Did I Get Here?

While I am a S.W. major here at CNU, I'm also a senior trying to collect those final credits to graduate. That is how I ended up taking this course, my major advsior recommended it to me saying that it was, "not that hard" and that she heard it was fun from previous students. Regardless of the needs for the credits or however I got here via Dr. Valutis I am still excited! As the course has progressed, it isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be and that makes it fun. As my digital foot print increases and I find myself slowly opening up about my life on my social media platforms I see this class being beneficial in navigating that.

### Social Work

I found social work as I was actually on the way to wanting a degree in Political Science. I took an entry level course and the rest is history. I discovered there was so much more to social work than just CPS or the borderline negative tropes of the field. 

But it was the discovery of _Prental Social Work_ that really put the final “nail” on the coffin as many life to say. I had a passion for kids, babies to be specific, and stumbled upon subsection that dealt primarily with expecting moms and their support system. Getting them access to clothes, food, furniture, transportation. But also enrolling them in parenting class and urging many to break the cycle. This spoke to me because I had seen and heard so many instances of young moms wanting more for their unborn child but not sure about how to go about that. And when **Roe V Wade** was overturned I knew help and compassion was going to be needed more then ever only making me fully confident, excited and inspired for the field at hand.

### Let’s Get Personal

Now that that’s out the way. Again, I’m Kayla Caine, a local Newport News/ 757 kid. I didn’t go far for college, and to this day, I still can’t accurately answer why I went to college so close to home or why I chose CNU. But 15 minutes away lives my parents and younger sister (is 16 **_that_** younger?) along with my dog Rocky and a cat that was adopted during one of my semesters on campus. 

I supposed this was due to missing me as I have spent every summer since starting college not at home due to my involvement with Orientation. The past two years I was a Crew Leader then worked my way up to become Student Director of Orientation-one of my biggest achievements and proudest moments as of yet. Along with rechartering the Nu Epsilon chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated in the fall semester. I gained an eternal sisterhood and becoming my moms legacy is pretty cool if you ask me.

I have no idea where life will choose to place me. I believe that our lives are predestined-already written and this is the path we are walking. Wherever my predestined path takes me..I’m excited for growth and happiness at every turn.
