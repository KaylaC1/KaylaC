## Summary 

It all began with a website created by students of Loyola University New Orleans in a 1999 class, marking the 100 years since the publication of The Awakening. A decade later, another class of Loyola students came back to the website and revised it based on their study of Chopin's works and life and times. From there they created a website that explored and expanded further the information on various contexts of The Awakening. 


The website breaks itself down into three tabs where each tab explores a societal issue or topic that is talked about or introduced in Kate Chopin's work. Those three tabs are; Southern Culture, Women's Issues, Related Figures.


All about Southern Culture dives into how the south operated at the time period in which Chopin was writing. Chopin was famous for including what they call “local color” in her stories. This involved the slang, fashion, and other things that make the south unique. This section contains helpful information concerning The White League, Creoles, and the Cheniere Hurricane.


The tab about womens issues is incredibly loaded with a wealth of topics the websites covers as Chopins novels were about womens issues. Chopin was writing novels during her time period (19th century) which makes understanding the historical background important. That’s where this tab aims to tackle birth control, childbirth, a woman's proper role in the home and more set in the 19th century.


The related figures section is a great supplement to everything else the website provides. They list 4 people that are also authors or philosophers of that time period like Chopin. These peoples work correlates with the work Chopin was creating at that time, both fiction and nonfiction.

## Humanistic Claims and Evidence

While looking at the fields in the humanities that this project relates to, history aligns the most with the DH project. This website completely uncovers the historical evolution of items like birth control in the 19th century in a whole new way using Kate Chopin novels as a jumping point. It is completely dedicated to the historical view point of the 19th century. 


The Kate Chopin website does a great job at explaining how the historical context and significance plays a part in everything that they write on the site. On every tab they give multiple resources of ways that you can dive deeper into each topic through different lens of different people and different regions of the country and world. The information is so incredibly detailed and educational and makes intaking the information so much easier. 


Many times when we think of data we think of numbers and graphs, but I believe the Kate Chopin website takes a twist on data and uses pictures from the 19th century to their advantage. Every single tab includes some kind of graphic that correlates with the topic. They include diagrams of medical equipment, pictures of Kate and the area she grew up in, 19th century posters but no graphs. On topic of locations they were known to include a map of sorts. No tab included data that was compromised of numbers. 


## Technology Used/Developed

As the website was created in 1999 and updated around 2009 the technology aspect of website does lack. For that time, this website was so ahead of its time in the incorporation of the details of the site as the tabs and links within the website. I believe that reading online makes intaking information easier then reading through a book and the use of pictures and some videos help break up the text and allow the reader to understand the information in a new way. The website is incredibly easy to navigate between tabs. This is cool because having subtabs can cause many pages to seem overwhelming, but because the structure is so simple and panned out it makes it easy. Another important thing to note is that it’s also accessible to use and view on a smartphone. That was an issue with past pages that contained maps and elaborate graphs but this page was simple to navigate on a smaller screen.

## Accessibility

Many of the “issues” of this website isn’t accessibility or even usability of the website but rather how old it is. As I mentioned a little bit in the previous sections, the last time the website was updated was around 2009. The face of technology has grown light years since that time. This makes the current website they have incredibly simple to navigate, but lacks a certain interesting factor and many of the links do not work.


If you go on many sites now a days they have some kind of factor that makes it cool to use their site, such as toggle buttons or intricate visual points. The Kate Chopin site has a explicitly simple interface. If they wish to revisit the site, there are so many ways they can spice it up. One way I can see them doing this is reintroducing the visual components of the site.


As for the links that direct to sites or media pages that no longer work or exist, this is not the fault of the site or the people that made it. Many of those sites ceased to exist in the 20 years since the launch of the site. I recommend that the editors of the site comb through the links and take out ones that no longer exist. If they choose to replace the links with material that was similar, this could also be a great opportunity to introduce new content to the page.
