## Summary 

It all began with a website created by students of Loyola University New Orleans in a 1999 class, marking the 100 years since the publication of The Awakening. A decade later, another class of Loyola students came back to the website and revised it based on their study of Chopin's works and life and times. From there they created a website that explored and expanded further the information on various contexts of The Awakening. 


The website breaks itself down into three tabs where each tab explores a societal issue or topic that is talked about or introduced in Kate Chopin's work. Those three tabs are; Southern Culture, Women's Issues, Related Figures.


All about Southern Culture dives into how the south operated at the time period in which Chopin was writing. Chopin was famous for including what they call “local color” in her stories. This involved the slang, fashion, and other things that make the south unique. This section contains helpful information concerning The White League, Creoles, and the Cheniere Hurricane.


The tab about womens issues is incredibly loaded with a wealth of topics the websites covers as Chopins novels were about womens issues. Chopin was writing novels during her time period (19th century) which makes understanding the historical background important. That’s where this tab aims to tackle birth control, childbirth, a woman's proper role in the home and more set in the 19th century.


The related figures section is a great supplement to everything else the website provides. They list 4 people that are also authors or philosophers of that time period like Chopin. These peoples work correlates with the work Chopin was creating at that time, both fiction and nonfiction.
