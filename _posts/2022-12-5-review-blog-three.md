# Review Three

Reflection Blog

## Summary

Walking into class on the first day of school I didn’t quite know what to expect from the class or Dr. Stover. I had imagined it as a class that was going to be completely easy and allowed me to get a easy grade. But I was completely wrong, the class has allowed me to reimagine the way I think of Digital Humanities and think of new innovative ways to process social work concepts. In this reflection blog I am going to reflect on my semester in the course and what I have learned.


## What Is DH?

Coming into the class my definition of Digital Humanities was no where near what we have learned in class. I had believed that DH was all media and just things such as websites. Digital Humanities is so much more then that I have learned since taking this course, it is what I would call the intersection of digital technologies (websites, podcasts, tweeting) and the humanities. It includes the use of digital resources in the humanities, as well as the analysis of what they are studying. Because of this increase in work of DH I now have a better understanding of the field and what it means to say “studying digital humanities”

## Readings

One reading that truly helped me understand what Digital Humanities is and how it intersects it’s teachings in a lot of what we see in modern day academics is “Racism in the Machine: Visualization Ethics in Digital Humanities Projects” by Katherine Hepworth. I had a basis of the reading and understanding that the AI systems of searching is skewed in words and racial bias towards people of color and the damage that commits. Through this foundational knowledge plus learning how data workflow, certain visualization formats, and individual design decisions made potential for harm of any data visualization.


One reading I found possibly worth skipping were the tutorials that the CNU library typically publicizes to CNU students. I felt that  the tutorials didn’t provide me with much help in moving forward in the class.
