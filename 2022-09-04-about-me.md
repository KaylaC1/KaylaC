## About Me
Hi hi! Summing up a little bit about you in a few hundred words is harder then I thought! But I'm Kayla Caine (pronouns she/her) and I'm a Social Work major at [Christopher Newport University]((https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/sswa/)).

### How Did I Get Here?
While I am a S.W. major here at CNU, I'm also a senior trying to collect those final credits to graduate. That is how I ended up taking this course, my major advsior recommended it to me saying that it was, "_not that hard_" and that she heard it was fun from previous students. Regardless of the needs for the credits or however I got here via Dr. Valutis I am still excited! As the course has progressed, it isn't _exactly_ what I thought it was going to be and that makes it fun. As my digital foot print increases and I find myself slowly opening up about my life on my social media platforms I see this class being beneficial in navigating that.
