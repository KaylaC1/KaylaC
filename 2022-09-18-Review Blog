**_Summary_**
The Grand Tour Project is a journal that tracked the trajectory of travelers in the eighteenth century on a mass journey to Italy. Travelers had heard about the beautiful sights of the country and the promise of amazing education. These travelers consisted of the Enlightenment’s most brilliant minds; writers, scientists, artists, merchants, servants, and travel guides. These travelers were men, adventurous youth, and bold women. These paths led to exchanges and interactions that would reshape politics, the arts, culture, and practices of professionalism. 

There are countless published and unpublished travel journals, letters, and other accounts found in numerous archives. Yet this very abundance, which is incredibly helpful, poses a challenge when trying to document it all. There is no single or clearly defined archive for the Grand Tour. This is where Giovanna Ceserani, director of the Grand Tour Project, comes in. In 2008 she established it as one of the case studies within a separate project. She quickly realized that this branch of the project had a lot to offer and then moved it to become a standalone project.

**_Design_**
The project site design was created using coding languages HTML5 and CSS. The libraries used were Stanford's Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Mapping the Republic of Letters, and Spatial History Project. The use of the site design and the libraries allow the reader to get the full experience of the Grand Tour Project. They are able to interact with the graphs and maps on the site to get the most information and absorb the project in a whole new way. This is especially helpful for those who have to take information in a whole new way such as those with learning disabilities or those with language barriers. The in link texts allow readers to jump back and forth between pages easily when looking for content.

**_Claims & Evidence_**

This project would fall under the history field. Through this project and the experiences the website offers you are able to fully experience a piece of history. The Grand Tour Project provided by Standford provides detailed information of how they recieved the provided evidence. They detail how the Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy (compiled by John Ingamells from the Brinsley Ford Archive) helped them immensely to bring the research we’re able to consume on the site. 

As someone who knew very little about the project assignment I learned so much about this eighteenth century phenomenon through this website. Through the links that detail the history of the project and interactive graphs of the site such as maps that show the tracked movement of travelers in Italy I’m able to learn more about the Grand Tour. Data is separated and cimplied into five graphs and who offer a new statistical point. The graphs which are broken down are clearly marked with keys and descriptions on how to dissect the graphs. 

**_Critiques_**
The Grand Tour Project website provided by Stanford offers so much information to researchers; both new and returning to the subject. While looking at the website on a mobile device to help complete this assignment I was surprised to see how well the graphs carried over to a mobile format. If I had to give critiques to this website I would offer just one. Through this review I have raved about the cool interactive features of the graphs. These graphs are indeed super important and offer a unique way to absorb information. But these graphs are the only information that is offered about the Grand Tour project. There are no real tabs thats strictly words dedicated to facts about it. While graphs can help some learners, I feel like I lacked actually learning more due to there being no real content presented. 

To combat this I believe there are many easy solutions. A tab that explains the graphs in text form would also would be a good way for researchers to write down the information or use in their studies. If the project researchers are worried about how the information would come across; a good method would be to include a graph, map, or picture in the middle to break up the text as we learned about in class. 

**_Finished Thoughts_**
Overall, I though this project was really cool to learn about. I have never heard about this 18th century movement so I thought it was interesting. As someone who is a fan of Italian history and culture I believed the site really helped me understand the information. I would recommend this site to a number of people; those who wish to learn more about Italian history, those who wish to do this for fun, and even those who have to do this assignment next year!
